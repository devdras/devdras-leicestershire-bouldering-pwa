    overview: `The bouldering in Cademan Woods has been extensively climbed
and developed over the years. A 1993 guide by Geoff Mason and
Ken Vickers lists a few routes in the woods which are included in
this guide. More recently, Clint Maskell and Mike Adams have
transformed the woods into an extensive bouldering venue. The
problems from their development notes make up the majority of
the climbs found here. Clint has also been very generous in
offering advice and information for the guide. `,
    conditions: `The rock is well sheltered in light rain and extremely quick
drying. With a good wind problems can go from gopping to bone
dry in a couple of hours. Some of the problems may need a good
brush and some occasional gardening, a pair of secateurs and a
stiff brush can often come in handy and keep the problems from
falling into disuse. `,
    approach: `Finding your way around the woods can be tricky. This guide
uses a description of the approaches, a map and GPS
coordinates. The GPS coordinates can be found in the approach
sections and are formatted so that they can be copied into
Google to bring up a map. The coordinates for sectors such as
Cademan West or High Cademan will take you to the main
parking. The coordinates for individual boulders and areas within
a sector refer to the areas/boulders themselves.`,
    access: `Cademan Woods has become increasingly popular with climbers,
however, this increased traffic is presenting a threat to
continued access. Please keep an eye on the access advice on
UKC.com which will be more up to date than this guide. Many of
the issues that come with increased traffic can be addressed if
we park sensibly and pick up any litter found. Climbers need to
show that they are having a positive impact on the local
environment and community.`,

good spread of grades ranging from f3 to f7c. The Hidden Wall area offers a good
warm-up circuit with a few intermediate problems, while Cavalry Rock and the
Twenty Steps Area offer lines to challenge your average wad. Area classics include
Gonzo, Big Flake, and Crack of Wales. `,

Turolough Road meets Car Hill Road. However, parking here is limited. Alternatively,
park on Grace Dieu road and approach as for Grimley’s Rock (page 32). If you know
the area well it would be best to approach all areas as for Grimley’s to keep the
parking spaces free for others. Note: Local residents are becoming frustrated with
people parking on the sides of Turolough Road. Please park as for Grimley’s Rock,
on Grace Dieu Road, if the parking bays are full. `,
