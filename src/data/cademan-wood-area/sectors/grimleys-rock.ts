  approach: `Park on Grace Dieu Road between where it meets with Loughborough Rd and where it intersects with Car Hill Rd. There is a good public footpath leading into the woods on the left side of some allotments. When the footpath meets the tree line and bears right, take a vague path heading directly into the woods. Ignore the first path heading left along the fence and continue up the hill. Take the next little path on the left which will take you down to Grimley’s rock.`,
