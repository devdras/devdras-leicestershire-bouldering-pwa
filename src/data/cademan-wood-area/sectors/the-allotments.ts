  approach: `There is a good path running beneath the boulders in this area which can be accessed from a number of different points: For the Shark’s Tooth Area, park as for Grimley’s Rock (52.7473, -01.3600). Take the public foot path and follow it as it bears right along the base of the woods. A little further on is a path heading down and right, take this and Shark’s Tooth will become visible within the woods. Alternatively, park on Loughborough Rd (52.7475, -01.3510) between where it intersects with Cademan Street and Temple Hill. Take the path into the woods. Where the path splits head left for Shark’s Tooth Area or right for the other blocks in this area. Finally, you can use the large car park on Swannymote Road (52.7476, -01.3447). Take the path on the left of the car park. This will take you past a large outcrop where the rightmost problems in this area can be found. A map of the right hand side of this area, including this car park, is on page 36.`,
