  overview: `A good set of problems in the f3-f6A range, plus a mega f7C dyno. Swannymote Rock is one of the most beautiful spots in the Cademan area; unfortunately it is on private land and accessing it requires crossing several fences. As a result Swannymote Rock is under-visited given its quality and outlook.`,
  conditions: ``,
  approach: `Park in the layby on Swannymote Road or the car park to the south. Head north along Swannymote Road. When you see the crag head straight towards it, carefully crossing any fences encountered.`,

      overview: `This small outcrop is located on private land and there is no general access.
  Permission may be granted if you contact the landowner.
  There are a few good problems here, most are around f3-6a with a single
  f7c.`,
      conditions: ``,
      approach: `As you head towards Whitwick on Swannymote Road there is a lay by on the right
  shortly after passing the junction with Warren lane. If you find yourself at the large car
  park for High Cademan you’ve overshot it.
  There are no public footpaths leading to Swannymote Rock. The quickest approach is
  to walk alongside the road towards Warren Lane, when you see the crag on your left
  head directly to it (involves hopping fences). The First face is visible on the approach.
  For the back face head clockwise round
  the outcrop. Continue clockwise round the outcrop for Green Face and Quick Fix.`,
