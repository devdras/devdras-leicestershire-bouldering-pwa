  overview: `West is one of the larger sectors of the Woods. There are over 70 problems with a
good spread of grades ranging from f3 to f7c. The Hidden Wall area offers a good
warm-up circuit with a few intermediate problems, while Cavalry Rock and the
Twenty Steps Area offer lines to challenge your average wad. Area classics include
Gonzo, Big Flake, and Crack of Wales. `,

  approach: `If you are heading to Cavalry Rock or Hidden wall there may be parking where
Turolough Road meets Car Hill Road. However, parking here is limited. Alternatively,
park on Grace Dieu road and approach as for Grimley’s Rock (page 32). If you know
the area well it would be best to approach all areas as for Grimley’s to keep the
parking spaces free for others. Note: Local residents are becoming frustrated with
people parking on the sides of Turolough Road. Please park as for Grimley’s Rock,
on Grace Dieu Road, if the parking bays are full. `,
